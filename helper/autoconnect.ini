### Example config file

# Values from the DEFAULT section are applied to all devices, other sections with the
# MAC address can override config elements for the specific device.
# Only devices that have a section are considered by the auto detection mechanism, but
# it can be empty to run with pure defaults.

# Key names are identical to the long parameters without dashes:
# specify "mtu = 20" to get "--mtu 20", this works also with flags like "--verbose".
# The only special key is "executable", which specifies the program that is started.
